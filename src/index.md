  <h2>About me</h2>
  <p>My name is Bimei Li and I am studying at Borough of Manhattan Community College now. 
  My major is Multimedia Programming and Design. I am going to transfer to the 4years college 
  in fall 2024. I have done some school projects such as creating simple web pages and designing
